\title{Time Series Data Collection Method}
\usage{
time_series(params, reference_geo_code = "US")
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list containing parameters including logger, folder_name, data_format, time_window, and other necessary parameters for sub-functions.}

\item{reference_geo_code}{Country/State/City to be used as reference point to rescale the data in later part}
}
\description{
This function collects time series data using the Google Trends API. It dynamically selects between daily, weekly, or monthly data collection based on the time window specified.
}
\details{
This method collects Google Trends time series data by calling pytrends.interest_over_time(). By default, Google provides weekly data if the time period between start and end dates is more than 270 days, and monthly data if it's more than 270 weeks. This function handles the collection of daily/weekly data in chunks less than 270 days/weeks to accommodate Google's limitations.
The collected data is saved in the structure: \code{folder_name/data_format/over_time/reference_geo_code}.
