\usage{
install_python_deps(envname = "pytrends-in-r", method = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{envname}{Name of the virtual environment. The default is "pytrends-in-r".
If the virtual environment does not exist, it will be created.}

\item{method}{Method to use for installation. Options are "auto", "virtualenv",
or "conda". The default is "auto", which will automatically choose the best
method based on the system configuration.}
}
\value{
NULL. This function is called for its side effects.
}
\description{
This function installs the required Python packages for this R package.
It ensures that the necessary Python environment is set up and that all
dependencies are installed.
}
\details{
This function checks if the specified virtual environment exists. If it does
not exist, it creates the virtual environment. It then installs the required
Python packages (`pandas`, `requests`, `pytrends`, and `rich`) into the
virtual environment. This is essential for the proper functioning of the R
package, which relies on these Python packages for data manipulation,
API requests, Google Trends data collection, and enhanced logging.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Install dependencies using the default virtual environment and method
install_python_deps()

# Install dependencies specifying a different virtual environment
install_python_deps(envname = "my-env")

# Install dependencies using conda
install_python_deps(method = "conda")
}
