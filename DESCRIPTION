Description: Google Trends provides cross-sectional and time-series search data but lacks readily available 
    longitudinal data. Researchers face practical challenges, such as normalized counts that hinder the 
    combination of regional and time-series data, and restrictions on data formats and timelines that limit data 
    granularity over extended periods. 
    This package addresses these issues, enabling researchers to generate longitudinal Google Trends data.  
    As long as 'Google Trends API', 'pytrends' and all their dependencies work, this package will also work!
    During the initialization stage, when users run the initialize_request_trends() method, two 
    folders will be created automatically - a parent folder with a user-defined name and path, and a sub-folder corresponding to the selected data format.
